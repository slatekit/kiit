/**
 * @requestsBeforeTracking : number of requests to process at startup before checking for errors
 *                             this is just to provide some warmup and have enough requests for proper
 *                             determination of error percentages. e.g. if 1 error out of 2 requests,
 *                             thats already 50%, but it could be 1 error out of 20 if let it run
 * @errorThresholdPercentage : The error percentage that triggers closing the gate
 * @volumeThresholdPerMinute : The volume threshold of total requests that trigger
 * @retryCount : The number of tries to retry a single failure
 * @subCountResetLimit : The limit until the subcount is reset
 * @reOpenTimesInMinutes : The time in minutes to re-open the gate after each close.
 *                             This is an exponential back-off
