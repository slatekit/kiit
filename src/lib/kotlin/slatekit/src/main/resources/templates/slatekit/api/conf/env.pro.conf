# Example: Override the db settings for prod to indicate
# loading the info from a file called "db-pro.txt" from the users folder.
# e.g. /<user>/<company>/<app>/db.pro.txt
#
# This is an added security measure to avoid production settings
# being stored in the config directory/files. User folder is :
#
# 1. more secure
# 2. not stored in source control
# 3. stored in /<user>/<company>/<app>/db.pro.txt
#
# NOTE: This is a pattern recommended by amazon.

# environment info
env.name = "pro"
env.mode = "pro"
env.desc = "production environment"


# log and level
log.name     = "@{app.name}-@{env.name}-@{date}.log"
log.enabled  = true
log.level    = "warn"


# database
db.enabled = true
db.source  = "user.file"
db.file    = "db-pr1.txt"
