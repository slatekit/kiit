# OVERVIEW:
# 1. Env files are "inherited" e.g. "env.loc.conf" and "env.dev.conf" inherit from "env.conf"
# 2. This env.conf contains the selected environment as env = loc, which points to "env.loc.conf"
# 3. This selected environment can be overriden on the commandline via -env=qat
# 4. settings can be overriden in the derived files.
# 5. The supported environment specific config files are:
# dev = env.dev.conf ( development )
# qat = env.qat.conf ( qa testing  )
# loc = env.loc.conf ( local dev   )
# pro = env.pro.conf ( production  )
env = loc
