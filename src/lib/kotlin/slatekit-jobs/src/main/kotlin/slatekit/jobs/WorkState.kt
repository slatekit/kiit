/**
 * Represents the state of a single iteration of work done by a worker
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1. Note to be confused with @see[slatekit.common.Status] which represents status of the whole Worker
 * 2. More : indicates a worker can keep handling more work
 * 3. Next : indicates a worker can completed this page/iteration of work and can proceed to the next page/iteration
 * 4. Done : indicates a worker is done and should be transitioned to @see[slatekit.common.Status.Complete].
 *           this is particularly useful in the case where a worker does NOT work from tasks from a
 *           a @see[slatekit.common.queues.QueueSource], but is self managed
 * 5. Each worker needs to return this result so that its next state can be determined
