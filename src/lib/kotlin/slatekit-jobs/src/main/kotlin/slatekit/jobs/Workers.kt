/**
 * Represents a cluster of Workers that are affiliated with 1 job.
 * This helps manage the coordination between a @see[Worker] and a @see[slatekit.jobs.Manager]
 * This is done by this class interpreting the @see[WorkResult] returned by a Worker
 * Based on the WorkResult, this may send commands @see[slatekit.jobs.support.Command]s to a Job's Channel
 * Essentially, this works like a glorified loop over each work, continuously:
 * 1. checking its WorkResult
 * 2. sending more commands to the Job's channel to pause, resume, process etc.
 * 3. handling errors
 * 4. notification of state changes
