/**
 * Task represents a unit-of work ( a work-item  ) that is handled by a Worker.
 * A task is stored as a single message in queue or a record in a database.
 *
 * @param id    : The id of the Task ( a UUID )
 * @param from  : The origin source/queue from which this task came from
 * @param job   : The name of the job associatd with this task                        e.g. "notifications"
 * @param name  : The name of this task ( to distinguish which worker can handle it ) e.g. "sendNewsLetter"
 * @param data  : The inputs/data of the job as a json payload
 * @param xid   : Serves as a correlation id
 * @param tag   : Serves as a way to label this item
 * @param entry : An instance of the message/record from the queue. Used to acknowledge/completete/fail
 * @param queue : The raw source/instance of the job from the queue ( e.g. could be the QueueSourceMsg )
 * @sample:
 *
 *  id       = "ABC123",
 *  from     = "queue://notifications",
 *  job      = "job1"
 *  name     = "users.sendWelcomeEmail",
 *  data     = "JSON data...",
 *  xid      = "abc123"
 *  tag      = "JIRA-1234"
 *  entry    = e.g. @see[slatekit.core.queues.QueueEntry]
