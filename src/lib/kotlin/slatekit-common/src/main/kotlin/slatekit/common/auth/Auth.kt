 * Provides a reasonable mechanism for ONLY inspecting an authenticated or non-authenticated user
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1. This component does NOT handle any actual login/logout/authorization features.
 * 2. This set of classes are only used to inspect information about a user.
 * 3. Since authorization is a fairly complex feature with implementations such as
 *    OAuth, Social Auth, Slate Kit has purposely left out the Authentication to more reliable
 *    libraries and frameworks.
 * 4. The SlateKit.Api component, while supporting basic api "Keys" based authentication,
 *    and a roles based authentication, it leaves the login/logout and actual generating
 *    of tokens to libraries such as OAuth.
